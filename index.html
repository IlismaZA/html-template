    <p>This book suggests a new explanation for why international peace interventions often fail to reach their full potential. Based on several years of ethnographic research in conﬂict zones around the world, it demonstrates that everyday elements - such as the expatriates' social habits and usual approaches to understanding their areas of operation - strongly influence peacebuilding effectiveness. Individuals from all over the world and all walks of life share numerous practices, habits, and narratives when they serve as interveners in conﬂict zones. These common attitudes and actions enable foreign peacebuilders to function in the ﬁeld, but they also result in unintended consequences that thwart international eﬀorts. Certain expatriates follow alternative modes of thinking and acting, often with notable results, but they remain in the minority. Through an in-depth analysis of the interveners' everyday life and work, this book proposes innovative ways to better help host populations build a sustainable peace.</p>

    <p>'In this book, Séverine Autesserre makes another superb contribution to the study of peacebuilding, this time by exposing and analyzing the subculture of expatriates who participate in peacebuilding eﬀorts on behalf of a diverse array of international and nongovernmental organizations. Many of the persistent dysfunctions of peacebuilding missions, she suggests, can be traced back to the routine practices, habits, and narratives within this subculture. It is a fascinating argument, of importance to both students and practitioners of peacebuilding.'

    <p>This book shows how everyday factors, which usually go overlooked, such as peacebuilders habits, procedures, and narratives, signiﬁcantly affect the effectiveness of their efforts. The argument adds a major piece to the puzzle of explaining international interventions successes and failures. The book is masterfully written, weaving together extensive primary ethnographic research from many conﬂict zones, including Congo, Sudan, Afghanistan, Burundi, and Timor Leste, alongside a thorough reading of secondary sources, and the authors personal reﬂections on her time as a peacebuilder. Peaceland is a pleasure to read and is set to become a major contribution to the ﬁeld of peacebuilding. I enthusiastically recommend it to scholars and practitioners alike.</p>
